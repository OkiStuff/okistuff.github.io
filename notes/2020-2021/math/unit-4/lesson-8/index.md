**Every weekend, Team Rhino and Team Yeti play each other at 2-Goal Soccer. This means they play until 2 goals are scored. Sometimes game last only a few minutes, sometimes games seem to go on forever. Over a 12-week season, which team is likely to win more games? Explain your choice in the discussion for today's lesson.**

Spinner A
---

Total outcome = 8

Favorable outcome = 3

Probability = 3/8 = 0.375 = 37.5%

Spinner B
---

Total outcome = 16

Favorable Outcome = 5 

Probability = 5/16 = 0.3125 = 31.2

Bag of Candy

{
14 cherry
12 watermelon
20 grape
5 lemon
} 50 total outcome

p(watermelon) = 12/50 * 2 both sides = 24/100 = 24%

p(cherry) = 13/50 * 2 both sides = 25/100 = 26%

p(not grape) = 30/50 * 2 both sides = 60/100 = 60%

**Experimental Probability**
===

For a given experiment:
Experimental probability = number of times the event occurs/total number of trails

Francesco has a bag of marbles. He removed one marble at random, recorded the color and then placed it back in the bag. He repeated the process several times and recorded his results in the table. Find the xperimental probability of drawing each color.

| Color       | Frequency     |
| :------------- | :----------: |
|  Red | 16   |
| Yellow   | 9 |
| Blue | 25 |
50 trials

p(red) = 16/50 = 0.32 = 32%

p(yellow) = 9/50 = 0.18 = 18%

p(blue) = 25/50 = 0.5 = 50%

1) A jar contains 4 cherry cough drops and 10 honey cough drops. You choose one cough drop without looking. The cough drop is cherry.
 - 4 cherry, 10 honey, Total: 14, Most common: Honey, cherry: 4/14 = 0.285 = 28.5%

2) 52 cards, pick black card, 13 clubs, 13 spades, 13 hearts, 13 diamonds
 - idk, 50%

3) 12 pieces of fruit, Five are lemon, rest are limes, You pick a lime. Lime: 7/12 = 0.583 = 58.3%

4) 12 choices, you roll > 2 and < 5, p(3,4) = 33%
