<h1>Compound Event</h1>
<hr>
<p>A Simple event consists of one event:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling one die</li>
<li>Flipping a coin</li>
</ul>
<p>A compound event consists of two or more simple events..</p>
<h1>Theroretical Probability of Compound Event</h1>
<hr>
<p>Jacob rolls two number cubes. Find the probability that the sum of the numbers he rolls is 8.</p>
<p>Use a table to show the sample space</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the total possible outcomes? 12</li>
<li>How many of the outcomes give the sum of 8? 5</li>
<li>What is the probabililty? ~41%</li>
</ul>
<p>What sum has the highest probability of being rolled?</p>
<p>What sum has the lowest probabililty of being rolled?</p>
